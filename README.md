# GHisBERT
In this repository, you'll find the code for training GHisBERT (bert_pretraining.ipynb), a BERT-based language model trained from scratch on historical data covering all attested stages of German (going back to Old High German, c. 750 CE). In addition, the repository provides the code for training a historical German BERT tokenizer (bert_tokenizer.ipynb) and for fine-tuning the dbmdz German BERT-base model (bert_finetuning.ipynb).
